## Scientific Computing with Python - Certificate Projects
Welcome to the repository for the Scientific Computing with Python certificate projects! This repository contains solutions to five projects that are part of the certification curriculum. Each project focuses on a different aspect of scientific computing and Python programming.

## Projects
# 1. Solution for Arithmetic Formatter
This project involves creating a function that receives a list of arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally display the answers.

# 2. Solution for Budget App
In this project, you will create a Category class that can be used to create different budget categories. The class should allow for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds between categories, as well as providing a summary of the budget.

# 3. Solution for Polygon Area Calculator
This project requires the creation of a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Rectangle class should be able to calculate the area and perimeter, and the Square class should inherit from the Rectangle class.

# 4. Solution for Probability Calculator
In this project, you will create a Hat class that represents a hat containing balls of different colors. The class should have a method for drawing a specified number of balls at random. You will also write an experiment function to determine the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls.

# 5. Solution for Time Calculator
This project involves writing a function that adds a duration to a start time and returns the result. The function should handle different formats and optionally include the day of the week.

# Note
The questions may change with time, if so deal with itâ€¦ Good Luck!

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
